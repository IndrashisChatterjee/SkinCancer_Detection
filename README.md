## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- the overfitting issue is clearly reduced now than what we saw in Model 1 along with gain in accuracy than Model 2
- the class rebalance has helped in both getting good accuracy as well as reducing overfitting. However more improvements can be brought by introducing more layers or increasing epochs (resource constraints).

## Technologies Used
- numpy - version 1.19.5
- matplotlib - version 3.2.2
- tensorflow - version 2.8
- PIL- v 7.1.2
